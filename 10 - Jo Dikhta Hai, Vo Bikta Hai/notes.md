If you want to have a customized value in tailwind, use brackets
- eg: width for 200px will be equal to w-[200px]

CTRL + Spacebar if extension is not making suggestions

Tailwind Pros
- do not need to move files
- very lightweight, bundling will only include css that is required for our app

Tailwind Cons
- long classNames
- high initial learning curve (but its extension makes it easier!)
